# Surfs Up
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if a surf shop that also sells ice cream will be profitable on a beach in Oahu. More specifically, it is looking for temperature trends during the months of June and December with the intent to use that as a determinant of how many sales can be expected during those months.

## Results
* June temperature information <img width="125" alt="June stats" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101011641/167311102-508a488c-e28c-4fac-b391-f370f1ad416a.png">
* December temperature information <img width="150" alt="December stats" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101011641/167311116-b9b4cbc6-243f-4c2b-beec-ac66cb851abc.png">


* The average temperatures in Oahu in June and December have an almost 4 degree Farenheit difference, with the June temperatures falling at an average of 74.94 degrees and December with an average of 71.04 degrees.
* There are fewer data points for the December data (1517 count) versus the June data (1700 count), which indicates that the sources of the information are less active in December than June
* The standard deviation is slighly larger in December than in June, so there is a larger variance in temperature during December than June.

## Summary
Based on the information in this analysis, there seems to be less activity, and potentially interest, in the area during the month of December versus June. This is likely because the temperatures are generally lower during the month of December than in June. However, the average temperature in December only has about one standard deviation difference in temperature, which is not statistically significant. Further analysis of the precipitation levels would be useful in understanding why there is less activity during December than in June. It would also be useful to pinpoint which stations report the temperature more regularly to determine which stations are more accurate.
